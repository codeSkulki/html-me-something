						Number 5 on my list is You Made It Weird with comedian/talk-show host Pete Holmes. This endearing yet hilarious interview styled podcast will really surprise you. From the anecdotes of hallucinogenic shroom trips to stories of the hardest times the guests have laughed, Pete's genuine and approachable nature makes it easy for comedians to share their weirdness with him.

						Number 4 is my favorite advice podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me. The McElroy brothers do their best to help those in need, especially those who reach out to the <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a> community for guidance. Whether you listen for their actual tidbits of advice or just for their brotherly love, you're sure to have some laughs.

						Coming in at number 3 is Comedy Bang! Bang! and it's inarguably the most ridiculous podcast on the list. Each week our host Scott Aukerman has a guest on and interviews them before being interupted by various other "guests" that show up. This improv comedy podcast has definitely made me laugh longer and harder than any other on this list, but might take a few listens to catch on to the endless in-jokes they callback to. Heynong Man!

						The penultimate podcast on my list, number 2 is High &amp; Mighty. Jon Gabrus is our host and I'll be honest and just admit he's my favorite comedian. Although Gabrus is a beloved improv comedian, this podcast of his is where he is surprisingly at his most tame. Each week Gabrus and a friend attempt to stay on topic to a previously agreed upon subject. While clearly (and he fully admits this) an indulgence project of his, it's a treat to learn more and more about him each week and hear humorous anecdotes from him and his guests.

						The top of my list at number 1 is Doughboys, the podcast about chain restaurants. This is my absolute favorite podcast. While certainly being 'about' chain restaurants, the shows main appeal is the hilarious aggressive-like banter between our two hosts Nick Wiger and Mike Mitchell. Every week they review a chain restaurant with a comedian/comedy-adjacent friend and give it a rating from 0 to 5 forks. Whether or not you have even heard of the chain they are discussing that week I assure you is a near irrelevant point of interest for the episode's entertainment. Our two hosts have such an amazing comedic chemistry they're etching away into the comedy duo hall of fame. I've yet to hear about someone who regularly listens to this podcast and have it not be their favorite. Do yourself a favor and join the Golden Plate Club of fans and start listening.
